# 🧩 Revit Automation Scripts

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains a collection of **Dynamo and Python scripts** developed to automate repetitive tasks in Autodesk Revit.  
Each script focuses on improving efficiency, consistency and accuracy in BIM workflows.

These scripts are designed and tested on **Autodesk Revit 2023, 2024 and 2025**, but most of them should work on other versions with minimal adjustments.

These scripts were created to **eliminate repetitive actions**, reduce errors, and allow engineers to focus on deliverables instead of clicks.
